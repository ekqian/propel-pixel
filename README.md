# Make Traveling more Eco-Friendly

PropelPixel is a web app that let's users track their commutes and earn VeChainThor tokens when taking more eco-friendly modes of transportation, i.e. public transport, ridesharing, walking, and biking.

The app is currently still in production, but a local version of the app can be run by following the instructions.


The frontend was created using React.js and the backend was created using Node.js and Express. Firebase was used for the database.


Features of this app include user sign up/log in/log out, RESTful API and API calls, integration with a database, and fullstack functionality for a CRUD app.
